The php backend implements a script that handles a HTTP request to a server. The script first establishes a connection to a database using the mysqli extension. The database credentials (server name, username, password, and database name) are stored in variables that are empty in this code.

The script then sets up HTTP headers for the response, allowing for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) and specifying the content type as JSON with UTF-8 encoding.

If the incoming HTTP request method is a GET request, the script returns an error message in a JSON object.

The script checks the value of the action parameter in the POST request. If action is equal to "exampleHTTPRequest", the script retrieves data from a table named "example_products" in the database and returns the data as a JSON object.

If requestSession is set in the POST request, the script validates the session by checking if the value of requestSession is present in the "example_sessions" table in the database. If the session is invalid, the script returns an error message in a JSON object.

If the session is valid, the script checks the value of action again. If action is equal to "exampleHTTPLogin", the script validates the username and password against the "example_users" table. If the username and password are correct, the script returns a success message in a JSON object and deletes the corresponding session from the "example_sessions" table. If the username or password is incorrect, the script returns an error message in a JSON object.

If action is equal to "exampleHTTPRegister", the script checks if the username, password, and email are set in the POST request. If they are, the script checks if the username and email are unique in the "example_users" table. If they are unique, the script inserts a new record into the "example_users" table with the specified username, password, email, and a generated token. The script then returns a success message in a JSON object.
